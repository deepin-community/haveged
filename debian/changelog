haveged (1.9.8-4) unstable; urgency=high (RC bug fix)

  * debian/haveged.service: Break ordering cycle
    Drop ordering constraint with systemd-journald
    Closes: #950418, #950540

  * debian/control: Build-Depends on debhelper (>= 12.3)
    Closes: #944040

haveged (1.9.8-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/haveged.service
    + Sync with upstream's version
      - Service ordering changes
        - Start after systemd-tmpfiles-setup-dev.service
          This is required, otherwise /dev/random might not yet exist.
        - Start before systemd-journald
        - Set WantedBy=sysinit.target (rather than multi-user.target)
      - Drop `NoNewPrivileges` (useless, as haveged keeps running as root)
      - Update SuccessExitStatus
      - Always restart the service
      - Allow running haveged in containers
      - Normalise on Boolean “true” instead of “yes”

    + Tighten-down security settings
      - Apply a syscall filter to the service
      - Set ProtectHostname, ProtectKernel{Logs,Modules}
      - Set Restrict{Namespaces,Realtime}, preventing access to
        potentially-vulnerable kernel features.
      - Set LockPersonality, MemoryDenyWriteExecute


  * Declare compliance with policy v4.5.0.
    No change required.

  * Remove obsolete debian/source/include-binaries

haveged (1.9.8-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix haveged-udeb by bumping SONAME in shlibs.local; otherwise, the
    udeb would get a dependency on non-udeb libhavege2, rendering it
    uninstallable and breaking d-i builds (Closes: #944189).

haveged (1.9.8-1) unstable; urgency=high (systemd boot fix)

  [nicoo]
  * New upstream version 1.9.8  (Closes: #934971)
    + Remove patches merged upstream
    + libhavege: Update symbols file, bump soname.
      Upstream removed visibility of havegecmd in v1.9.7, which is ABI-breaking.

  * debian/watch
    + Deal with new release tag names
    + Stop expecting signed releases.
      Upstream stopped signing releases, this is a known issue:
        https://github.com/jirka-h/haveged/issues/2

  * debian/rules: Fixup for debhelper/12.3
    dh_makeshlibs now detects the library in haveged-udeb, but complains it
    is not shipped in haveged (since it's shipped in libhavege2)

  * debian/control
    + Use HTTPS for the Homepage link.
    + Declare compliance with policy v4.4.1.
      No change required.

  [Dan Streetman]
  * haveged.service: do not order After=systemd-random-seed.service
    Upstream systemd has recently changed systemd-random-seed.serivce to
    no longer be ordered before sysinit.target.
    However, since haveged orders itself After=systemd-random-seed and also
    Before=sysinit.service, it is now causing boot delays:
      https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/13252
    Closes: #938939

haveged (1.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ nicoo ]
  * New upstream version 1.9.4 (Closes: #906294)

  * Add myself as an uploader
  * New upstream maintainer
    + Update debian/copyright, debian/watch
    + Switch to new-style upstream signing keys, update signing keys
    + Forward Debian patches (as Github PRs), update patch metadata

  * Amend the changelog for 1.9.1-6.
    It should have closed #866513, as the start ordering issue was likely the
    problem.

  * libhavege1
    + Add Build-Depends-Package to symbols file
    + Update symbols file

  * Comply with policy v4.4.0
    + Set Rules-Requires-Root: no
    + Install the upstream changelog as NEWS.gz
    + debian/copyright: Use HTTPS format URI

  * debian/control
    + Replace `Priority: extra` with `optional`
    + Drop obsolete -dbg package (Closes: #874627)
    + Add missing Pre-Depends for haveged

  * debian/gbp.conf
    + Update the name of the debian branch
    + Enable use of pristine-tar by default

  * Switch to debhelper 12, remove the old-style debian/compat file
  * Add missing installed paths, not-installed, make dh_missing failing
  * Simplify debian/rules

  [ Ondřej Nový ]
  * d/control: Set Vcs-* to salsa.debian.org

 -- nicoo <nicoo@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Aug 2019 16:34:34 +0200

haveged (1.9.1-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update apparmor profile: add write access to /run/haveged.pid as that
    would get DENIED when running under sysvinit (Closes: #911604). That's
    not an issue when running under systemd as PID file handling isn't
    needed there.

haveged (1.9.1-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Add haveged-udeb, for use from the Debian Installer (See: #923675,
    Closes: #927376).
  * Bundle the daemon and the library in haveged-udeb, since the daemon
    is the only user of the libhavege.so.1 SONAME.

  [ Ondřej Nový ]
  * d/control: Set Vcs-* to salsa.debian.org

haveged (1.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable NIST test suite on mips and mipsel as it takes way
    too long on these architectures. At least long enough to prevent the

haveged (1.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add patch by Sven Hartge to overcome mips build failures:
    let's make the CUSUM and RANDOM EXCURSION tests be a little more
    verbose about their progress. That should help us stay under the 5
    allowed minutes of inactivity.
